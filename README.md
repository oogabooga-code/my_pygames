#Python

Have you ever thought of finding a code that creates a game?
Or that can make files move to another place?
Or that you can write stuff on it and it can tell you WHERE to GO?

#You --> ( 'o')||I want to find a code that i can use to create a game||''''||Then go to My_Python-codes||(0-0 ) <--- Me

___________________________________
What is My_Python-codes for? ? ?
___________________________________

My_Python-codes is used to show you codes that can make cool stuff and that you can acess it.
You can see Python in My_Python-codes. So i use python.

#('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0') ('0')
AND DO NOT ASK TO MAKE A CODE OUT OF SCRATCH OR SOMETHING ELSE THEN PYTHON! 

Like if you want to make a simple game of dodging the projectiles, i can do it if you ask me.
but do not make it super complex like Zelda or Mario or Minecraft

Shoud i use it?

but pls like it. I worked hard for this (or didin't i...)
anyways but i should consider using ||||||| Visual Studio code |||||||

\(0-0 )/ /( 0o0)\
\(0-0 )/ /( 0o0)\
\(0-0 )/ /( 0o0)\
\(0-0 )/ /( 0o0)\
